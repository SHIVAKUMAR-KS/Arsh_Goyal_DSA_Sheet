# Examples

Input:
push1(2)
push1(3)
push2(4)
pop1()
pop2()
pop2()
Output: [3, 4, -1]
Explanation:
push1(2) the stack1 will be {2}
push1(3) the stack1 will be {2,3}
push2(4) the stack2 will be {4}
pop1()   the poped element will be 3 from stack1 and stack1 will be {2}
pop2()   the poped element will be 4 from stack2 and now stack2 is empty
pop2()   the stack2 is now empty hence returned -1.

# Exaplanation
In this problem two stack will given and one  array will be given ,the things is store the element in array after performing the operation for both stack1 and stack2

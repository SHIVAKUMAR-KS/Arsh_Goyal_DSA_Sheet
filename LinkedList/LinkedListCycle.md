# This problem is also known as detect a cycle

# Examples
Example 1:


Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
Example 3:


Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 
 ```
 public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow=head;
        ListNode fast=head;

        while(fast!=null && fast.next!=null){
            slow=slow.next;
            fast=fast.next.next;

            if(slow==fast){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
        
    }
